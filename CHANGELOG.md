## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### 🎉 New Features & Breakthroughs

#### **Themed Variant System**

- **Unified Variants**: Full support for `outline`, `filled`, `standard`, and `floating` variants across all input components.
- **Animated Notches**: Precision-engineered floating labels with a solid background notch effect.
- **Enhanced Date/Time Pickers**: `DatePicker`, `DateRangePicker`, `DateTimePicker`, and `TimePicker` now support the full variant system natively.

#### **CLI 3.0 Power Tools**

- **Dynamic Package Names**: Users can now specify a custom `packageName` during `init` for highly tailored local installations.
- **Component Tracking**: The new `r-form.json` config tracks every component installed in `copy` mode.
- **`update` Command**: Introduced a powerful `update` command to automatically synchronize your local component source files with the latest upstream library versions.
- **Intelligent Dependency Resolution**: The `add` and `update` commands now recursively manage internal dependencies (like `theme-core` and `date-utils`).

#### **Core Enhancements**

- **Native Implementation**: Fully transitioned from external UI libraries to high-performance, tailored native components for all Date/Time operations.
- **Floating Labels for Selects**: Integrated floating label animations into `Select` and `Autocomplete` components.
- **Library Exports**: Expanded the public API to export the complete suite of themed components.

### 🔧 Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: React 19.2, Tailwind CSS 4.1, Zod 4.3, date-fns 4.1.
